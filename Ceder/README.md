Ceder instances are small instances that are great to start from and evaluate some concepts. Avishai Ceder uses those instances to explain Network Design in the above mentioned book, a great resource to understand the problem and a compendium of recent literature methods.

This instance has one terminal node at Node ID 1, which means routes can only start from this node, but may end on other nodes before returning to terminal at node 1.
