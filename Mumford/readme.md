Instances general comments:

Mumford suggests a fixed number of routes per instance and a range of number of routes per route.

![](Suggestion.png)

As Mumford instances node location don't represent a real world exact location (as Mandl), node coordinates are used in place of latitudes and longitudes.

TODO
  - Gather and Include proposed route sets for all instances (best and Pareto frontier) as well as objective functions and addicional data and considerations from authors.
